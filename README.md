**My Awesome Portfolio**

This repository houses my first full-stack project, which is a headless CMS that uses React for the front-end and Sanity studio for the backend/headless CMS, which itself is deployed on netlify. Sanity uses graphql to fetch posts and projects, and allows the user to link and create new content within the studio suite. This was also the first project I used Tailwind CSS on. I like Tailwind for its ease of use and awesome documentation, which makes all commands very simple to find.
